            DES (Data Encryption Standard) and AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) both are the symmetric block cipher.
AES was introduced to overcome the drawback of DES. As DES has a smaller key size which makes it less secure to overcome
this triple DES was introduced but it turns out to be slower. Hence, later AES was introduced by the National Institute
of Standard and Technology. The basic difference between DES and AES is that in DES plaintext block is divided into
two halves before the main algorithm starts whereas, in AES the entire block is processed to obtain the ciphertext.
